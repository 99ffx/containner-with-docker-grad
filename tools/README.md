# Tools

Hopefully useful tools for the training material and associated course.


## find-non-ascii-7-characters.sh

Sometimes, showoff will crash if there are characters outside of the ASCII7
character set. This script detects and shows those characters.


## make-toc.py

Extract titles (to generate an outline to include in a conference submission
or similar).


## Where are the VM tools?

They have been rehauled and the new version is publicly available [here](
https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop/tree/master/prepare-vms).
