# Step 2: Make containers easy to use

* Container technology has been around for a while

    (c.f. LXC, Solaris Zones, BSD Jails)

* But, their use was largely limited to specialized organizations, with special tools & training. Containers were not portable
* Analogy: Shipping containers are not just steel boxes. They are steel boxes that are a standard size, and have hooks and holes in all the same places
* With Docker, Containers get the following:
  * Ease of  use, tooling
  * Re-usable components
  * Ability to run on any Linux server today: physical, virtual, VM, cloud, OpenStack, +++
  * Ability to move between any of the above in a matter of seconds-no modification or delay
  * Ability to share containerized components
  * Self contained environment - no dependency hell
  * Tools for how containers work together: linking, nesting, discovery, orchestration, ++
