# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Docker 30,000ft overview

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about:

* Containers (how and why they are useful)
* Docker (the Open Source project)
* Docker Inc. (the company)

We won't actually run Docker or containers in this chapter (yet!).

Don't worry, we will get to that fast enough!
