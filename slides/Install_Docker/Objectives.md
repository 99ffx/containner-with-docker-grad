# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Installing Docker
## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Install Docker.
* Run Docker without ``sudo``.

*Note:* if you were provided with a training VM for a hands-on
tutorial, do not run the commands in this lesson! That VM already
has Docker installed, and Docker has already been setup to run
without ``sudo``.
