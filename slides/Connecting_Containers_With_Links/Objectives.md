# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Connecting containers with links

## Objectives

Links were the "legacy" way of connecting containers (before the implementation of the CNM).

They are still useful in some scenarios.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create links between containers.
* Use names and links to communicate across containers.
